# C# OpenWeatherApp


## About

This is a simple .NET application that fetches and displays weather information for two cities, Nurmij√§rvi and Rovaniemi, using the OpenWeatherMap API. The application retrieves the current weather data and presents it in a user-friendly format, including temperature, humidity, and other weather statistics. The project was developed as part of the coursework for an object-oriented programming (OOP) course at Lapland University of Applied Sciences.
